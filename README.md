# GoT_NLP
Game of Thrones NLP project

This is a work-in-progress project to use NLP to identify GoT phrases indicative of certain characters (catchphrases/catch-terms) and to train a model to classify which character a snippit of text comes from.

All scripts acquired from Genius: e.g. https://genius.com/albums/Game-of-thrones/Season-1-scripts
